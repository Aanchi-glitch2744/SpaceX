# SpaceX
I have created this app using React and I have used fetch commands to fetch the data from API and deploy it into the website. I have also used Cards and CSS to design the area of information.

To run this on your local computer: us command "npm install" this will install all dependencies on your computer.

Then use "npm start" to deploy this website on localhost.
